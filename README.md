📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

**Bridging Traditional Economic Theory with Modern Machine Learning**

---

## About This Portfolio

Welcome! I'm an undergraduate economics student exploring the intersection of finance and AI research. This repository showcases my work from **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm developing skills that bridge causal inference with predictive analytics.

### The Approach

This course follows a *Concept Extension* philosophy: we start with foundational statistical methods—like ordinary least squares regression—and systematically scale them using machine learning techniques such as Lasso regularization, tree-based models, and ensemble methods. The goal is to understand not just *how* these tools work, but *when* and *why* to apply them to economic questions.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Labs & Coursework**: Hands-on implementations connecting economic intuition to data science practice
- **Causal Inference**: Techniques for identifying cause-and-effect relationships in observational data
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning approaches adapted for economic forecasting and policy analysis

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation & analysis
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models
- **Statsmodels** – Econometric estimation & inference
- **Google Colab** – Collaborative notebooks
